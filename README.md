# processor_simulator_v1
In this Python simulation we will ignore some details such as the bit manipulation, and the limitations of word sizes. Ignoring these details just makes the simulation a bit easier to use and program, including these details isn't difficult just very time consuming.

I will also use assembly instructions instead of machine code, since they are 1 to 1 mappable to one another, and machine code just adds unnecessary complexity to the readability of this project.
